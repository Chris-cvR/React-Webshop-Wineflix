Jezebelle has a style of its own closer to European Chardonnay than classic overseas. Harvested over a whopping 7 times at different ripening times to give as complex a wine as possible. So good fatness but still structure and a nice balanced barrel flavour - lovely. Aromas of lime, vanilla and flowers with a light mineral flavour.","id":14,"image":"https://www.wineguys.dk/9-home_default/jezebelle-chardonnay.jpg","list_price":129,"name":"La Vierge Jezebelle Chardonnay","country":"South Africa","year":2021,"category":"White","price":129,"url":"https://www.wineguys.dk/da/vinkatalog/14-jezebelle-chardonnay-6009825450216.html","quantity":1},{"brand":"Rijks Cellars","description":"A modern Pinotage with lots of aroma; blackcurrant, plum and chocolate.
